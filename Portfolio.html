		<p>This poster reflects the image classification result of a study area in the Rocky Mountains. 
		The study area was chosen because I thought a mountain region would be very interesting and challenging 
		to perform image classification due to the presence of shadows. This Landsat 8 image was captured in 
		August 2014 and required atmospheric correction. The original Landsat 8 band 1 was not used for this
		 particular project. The band 1 referred to in this project is the original Landsat 8 band 2. The initial 
		 plan was to classify this image based on 5 classes, which are water, planted field, bare soil, forest and urban. 
		 Two reference layers with band combinations 3-2-1 (true colour) and 4-3-2 (false colour infrared) would have been 
		 sufficient to collect adequate training sites. <br>

<br>However, during the process of collecting training sites, I discovered unusual land uses, 
which were found to be ice and snow after investigation. This was unexpected because the satellite
 image was taken in summer. Additional research was conducted to learn the appropriate band combination for 
 identifying snow and ice, which was 5-4-3. More challenges appeared after the first run of supervised classification.
  A fairly large, flat and continuous area was identified as snow. 
  It seemed extremely odd and did not correspond the mountainous nature of the landscape. 
  After some more in-depth research, I discovered that the area is a coal-mining field.
   It was a pleasant surprise. Some mountain shadows were classified as urban. 
   Yet, the result was still quite accurate due to the fact that I collected a good number 
   of training sites in shadowy regions. The accuracy assessment returned an overall accuracy of 76%.

		<p>This map is showing how to survive in Lindsay, Ontario when a zombie pandemic hits the city. The table contains locations that will provide shelter, food and medical assistance for survival. The map application contains a networking tool that will map out the route from one location to another without encountering zombies. 
It reroutes when a new barrier appears due to zombie attack.

		<p>This map is dedicated for everyone who loves pink and food! The Yorkville district contains diverse businesses including designer boutiques, five start hotels, art galleries and many fine dining restaurants. However, Yorkville can be difficult to navigate for first time visitors, especially when some small stores hide in corners and basements. The map mainly focuses on showing the spatial context of some top-rated restaurants and their spatial relationship with hotels, subway stations and parking lots. The table shows specific address and other information of each restaurant. The audience for this map can be people who are new to Yorkville, such as travellers and recent migrants. In addition, since there exist more than a hundred dining places in Yorkville, people who are from Toronto may also need this map. Personally, I do have a difficult time remembering where are the restaurants located in Yorkville despite the fact that I lived there for a year and went to the university next to it for four years. </p>
